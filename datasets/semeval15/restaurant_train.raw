one would think we 'd get an apology or complimentary drinks - instead , we got a snobby $T$ would n't even take our order for 15 minutes and gave us lip when we asked him to do so .

i 've also been amazed at all the new additions in the past few years : a new jazz bar , the most fantastic $T$ , the best thin crust pizzas , and now a lasagna menu which is to die for ( these are not your average lasagnas ) !
